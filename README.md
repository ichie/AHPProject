==========

This is my project about SLR. What is SLR?
SLR is Self-Regulated Learning. That's about how to know student is ready to study with her/himself or not.

About this app:
+ Admin(Teacher):
  - can add and manage user.
  - know all activities of user.
+ User(student):
  - do the exercise (can do more than 1)
  - view the result of exercise

This app still beta and there are many bug. I hope, there're can make it better.


Thank's,
